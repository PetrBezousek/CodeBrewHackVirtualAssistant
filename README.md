Submission for [CodeBrew Hackathon 2019](https://codebrewhack.com/behind-codebrew-hackathon-2019/).

I worked in team of 4 people. We all varied in age and programming skills.

Our task was to make Virtual Assistant in less than 48 hours.

We decided to make a Slack bot - slash commands respectively.

`/iamlate [message]`
- Send message about your status.

`/whereis [nickname]`
- Show status of user. Also notify them about you searching for them.

We made simple Flask API which could receive requests from Slack and respond accordingly.
